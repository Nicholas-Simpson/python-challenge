# python-challenge

This challenge consisted of 2 different python coding problems

The Pybank problem was the first 
    within this problem we were asked to:
    - get total Months included in dataset
    - The net total amount of "Profit/Loss" 
    - Change in "Profit/Loss" over the period, and then average of those changes
    - Greatest increase in profits 
    - Greatest decreasee in profits

The Pypoll Problem was second
    within this problem we were asked to:
    - get total number of votes
    - a complete list of candidates who recieved votes
    - the percentage of votes each candidate won
    - the total number of votes each candidate won
    - the winner of the election based on popular vote

With each of these problems we had to code and complete the problem using the provided
data from the csv. After we had finished coding the problems to print in the terminal
we were asked to also output the answers to a text file in the analysis folder we created.

Within my github you should see these files:

    PyBank folder
        analysis folder
            profit_loss_analysis (my output of the code from main)
        Resources folder
            budget_data (the data supplied for the problem)
        main (my code using python)

    PyPoll folder
        analysis folder
            election_analysis (my output of the code from main)
        Resources folder
            election_data (the data supplied for the problem)
        main (my code using python)
